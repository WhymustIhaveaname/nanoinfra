"""
Stream assembly for the text modality — the ONE place that turns declarations
into loaders, for training and evaluation alike.

The point of this module is structural: a training source and its validation
counterpart are built from the same declaration (dataset + split + recipe) by
the same code, so they cannot silently disagree. Previously training went
through ``TextDataSource`` (recipe-assembled) while evaluation called
``token_data_loader`` directly (raw packing), and nothing connected the two.

Config shape::

    data:
      datasets: {fineweb: {splits: {val: {files: [...]}, train: {rest: true}}}}
      recipes:  {text_pretrain: {template: [bos, text_start, text_tokens, text_end, eos]}}
      sources:  [{type: text, dataset: fineweb, split: train, recipe: text_pretrain, ...}]

    evaluation:
      streams:
        - {name: text, dataset: fineweb, split: val, recipe: text_pretrain, metric: val/text_ce}

``recipe: null`` is legal on a stream and means "assemble nothing" (raw packing).
It is never the default and never silent — a caller that wants it declares it,
the way a project-side ``--raw-ruler`` migration bridge does.
