"""
spec.py — THE knob panel: which three models this project trains, on what, at what size.

Everything downstream (assembly, configs, decoders, the web) reads its facts from
here, so re-targeting the project is a one-line edit rather than a hunt through
eight files. Same pattern as exemplars/text_pretrain/spec.py.

Three kinds of fact live here, and the distinction matters:

  1. PROTOCOL — the shared-vocab contract: the band table and its canonical type
     ids. Changing one silently invalidates every checkpoint ever trained, so
     assembly.py asserts the assembled layout still agrees with it.
  2. SHAPE — the video clip contract and hence the row length. DERIVED from three
     numbers, never written down twice.
  3. RECIPE — model size, LR, batch. Free to tune; nothing breaks.

THE ONE IDEA THIS FILE ENCODES. There is ONE band table. Each of the three lines
ACTIVATES a subset of it (LINES below). A line pays only for the bands it
activates — the model's vocab_size is the sum of its active bands, not of all of
them. Measured on this box (RTX 5090, d12/768): carrying one dead 32750-wide text
band costs 1.43x the step time. See PLAN.md "为什么按线装配".

#
# private/ is already gitignored (the repo root ignores `private/` at any depth), so
# none of it is committed. Two documents there are exceptions worth force-adding —
# PLAN.md and RESULTS.md — because the reasoning behind the decisions is worth
# keeping in history even though it is not for publication.

# The motion tokenizer. The shelf holds two, both 512 codes, and the rule that

# WAS TRAINED ON. Measured here (root-relative MPJPE, and a jitter reading = the norm
# of joint acceleration in cm/frame^2, which is what "the body shakes" actually is):
#
#   features      codec              height   jitter   MPJPE
#   bones_seed    (raw, no codec)     1.47     0.250     —
#   bones_seed    rot139_kin_fsq2     1.48     0.244    3.67 cm   <- its own corpus
#   bones_seed    rot139_vqvae        1.32     4.161   80.50 cm
#   amass         (raw, no codec)     1.24     1.205     —
#   amass         rot139_kin_fsq2     1.35     3.694   62.26 cm
#   amass         rot139_vqvae        1.26     3.103   16.29 cm   <- its own corpus
#
# So the choice is really a choice of CORPUS. We take Bones-SEED + fsq2, because that
# pair adds no jitter at all (0.244 against the raw 0.250 — the conv autoencoder
# smooths slightly) and reconstructs to 3.67 cm. The AMASS pair is the honest
# alternative and it is four times shakier before any codec touches it: real mocap
# carries real noise, while Bones-SEED is SOMA-retargeted and smooth by construction.
