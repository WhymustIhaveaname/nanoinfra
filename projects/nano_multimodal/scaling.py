"""
scaling.py — the compute-optimal scaling law, on the text line.

Trains one curve per model size at a FIXED token budget, takes the lower envelope
of the per-model curves, and reads the exponent a in N_opt ∝ C^a from it
(Chinchilla ≈ 0.5).

    python -m projects.nano_multimodal.scaling run --depths 8 6     # one GPU
    python -m projects.nano_multimodal.scaling run --depths 4 3 2   # the other
    python -m projects.nano_multimodal.scaling fit

The ladder is embarrassingly parallel — one depth per GPU, no communication — so a
pair of cards finishes it in about an hour. The fitting math is reused from
exemplars/text_pretrain/scaling_fit.py; the study it belongs to is done and
reproduces a ≈ 0.52, and none of it is reimplemented here.

WHY 500M PER SIZE, NOT 2B. The exemplar uses 2B so that every curve's bend AND its
flattening are visible. Its own comment records that at 500M this pipeline
reproduces the exponent to 0.004 — so the fourth decimal is what the extra 1.5B
buys, while a student is looking at "the curves cross, the envelope has a slope,
the slope is about a half". 500M turns roughly eight GPU-hours into two, which
fits a class. The cut is printed by `fit` with the 2B number beside it: a budget
quietly reduced is a result quietly weakened, and one reduced on the record with
its reason is a lesson about measurement.

WHY CONSTANT LR. Every point along one run has to be a legitimate endpoint, and an
end-of-run warmdown moves the last point by a lot (~0.37 nat on the video line).
Warmup is ABSOLUTE steps for the same reason: a ratio-based warmup re-tunes itself
whenever the budget changes, so the recipe would depend on how far right the line
runs.

WHAT THIS READS. metrics.jsonl, written by metrics.py — not the training log. The
exemplar has to parse its own stdout with a regex anchored on "Step N |", and it
carries a paragraph explaining why that regex is field-name-based rather than
positional. Having the numbers on disk in a machine format removes that whole
class of problem; it is the first payoff of the local metrics sink.
