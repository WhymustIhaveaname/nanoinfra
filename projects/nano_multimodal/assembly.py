assembly.py — line name -> everything a run needs. The ONE path into the data.

WHY THIS IS NOT INSIDE train.py. vision.md says orchestrators own assembly, and
train.py IS the orchestrator — but assembly has a SECOND legitimate consumer: the
data browser (serve/browse.py), which must show the batches training actually
sees. If the browser assembled its own loader, the two would be free to drift, and
this repo has already paid for exactly that bug once: training assembled sequences
through a recipe while evaluation packed raw tokens, the two rulers disagreed for
months, and nothing in the log ever said so (modalities/text/data_source.py
documents the post-mortem). One function, two callers, no room to disagree.

So: train.py is still the orchestrator (it decides WHAT to run and wires the
Trainer); this module is the assembly it owns, factored out so the browser can
walk the identical path.
