scaling.py — stage 2: the compute-optimal scaling law (per-model training curves).

Trains ONE run per model size (d2..d8) through the SAME blessed Orchestrator as
pretrain (spec.ORCHESTRATOR) to a fixed token budget at CONSTANT LR, evaluating
at ~40 LOG-SPACED steps along the way. The schedule is computed HERE and injected
via `evaluation.eval_at` — core evaluators accept an explicit step set; core
never computes schedules. Plotted as loss vs compute (C = 6·N·D), each size's
curve drops -> bends -> flattens toward its capacity floor; the LOWER ENVELOPE of
all curves is the compute-optimal frontier, from which

    a = slope(log N_opt vs log C) ~ 0.5      (N_opt proportional to C^a; Chinchilla ~0.5)

Deliberate choices:
  * Constant LR (scheduler warmdown off) so each curve reflects genuine
    loss-vs-compute, not an end-of-run warmdown dip.
  * LOG-spaced eval starting at step 20 (~0.66M tokens): the frontier exponent
    is acutely sensitive to the EARLY low-compute segment — sample it too late
    and the smallest and largest sizes never share a compute budget (RESULTS §2).
  * The SAME Orchestrator as pretrain (not a hand-rolled loop) — the scaling law
    characterises the real training loop, and rides the same snapshot guard.
  * ONE shared LR (the champion's 3e-4) across sizes — fine for the frontier's
    shape at this scale; a precision study would tune LR per size.

WHY curves + frontier (not a 2D grid + parametric fit): the frontier IS the
compute-optimal object — at each compute budget several sizes compete and the
envelope picks the single best.

Run — split the depths across both GPUs, then collect + fit + plot:
